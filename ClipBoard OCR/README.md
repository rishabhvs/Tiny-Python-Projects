# Clipboard OCR
This script is a python utility making use of the [Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) along with [PIL (Python Imaging Library)](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)  to read a copied image from the clipboard , perform OCR and copy the results back to the clipboard. Serves as an very useful tool , especially to instantly copy text from an image while working , rather than saving an image and upload that to a online service or opening up google lens on a mobile device and send the text back to your computer.
